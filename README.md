# Julia basics notes

Some notes used to tutor the basics of Julia.

Meant as a general introduction to basic programming concepts, using Julia as language, not as an intro to specificities of Julia.

Can also be useful for people who are familiar with other languages like Python, to get introduced to some basic syntax of Julia.

**--- Work in progress ---**

- Notes: two to three pages of introduction per subject with the most important syntax and some caveats.
- Exercises: some basic exercises to practice on.
